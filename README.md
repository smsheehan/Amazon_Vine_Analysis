# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate if there are any signs of bias in reviews left through the Amazon Vine Program.  According to Amazon (www.amazon.com/vine/about) "_Amazon Vine invites the most trusted reviewers on Amazon to post opinions about new and pre-release items to help their fellow customers make informed purchase decisions. Amazon invites customers to become Vine Voices based on their reviewer rank, which is a reflection of the quality and helpfulness of their reviews as judged by other Amazon customers. Amazon provides Vine members with free products that have been submitted to the program by participating vendors. Vine reviews are the independent opinions of the Vine Voices. The vendor cannot influence, modify or edit the reviews. Amazon does not modify or edit Vine reviews, as long as they comply with our posting guidelines._".  The intent of the program is _"to provide customers with more information including honest and unbiased feedback from some of Amazon's most trusted reviewers"._

Technical skills tested in this challenge involved creation of an AWS relational database, connecting the database to PGAdmin, importing data from S3 into a Google Colab notebook, and performing ETL on the dataset using PySpark. 



## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary:
